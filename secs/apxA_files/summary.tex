\subsection{Conclusions}
The full non-linear model for gas concentrations was derived based on a CSTR
model with reduced-order dynamics, that were previously justified in
literature. Model parameters were determined as explicit functions of reaction
rates and the catalyst's ammonia storage capacity.  Parameter identification,
beginning with the output equation and focusing on $NO_x$ sensor
cross-sensitivity ($\chi$), was carried out using RMC test-cell data from
degreened and aged catalysts. A preliminary indicator of aging was observed
from the catalyst's storage capacity versus temperature curve.
